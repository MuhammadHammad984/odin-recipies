    <h4>Desciption</h4>
    <p>
      Biscotti are Italian almond cookies. They are baked twice, which gives them their signature hard and crunchy texture. Biscotti are traditionally dipping in a drink before eating. These biscotti are easy, quick, and my favorite Italian cookies. My friend at work gave me this simple, no-frills recipe.
    </p>
    <h4>Ingredients</h4>
    <ul>
      <li> 1 cup white sugar </li>
      <li> ½ cup vegetable oil </li>
      <li> 3 large eggs </li>
      <li> 1 tablespoon anise extract, or 3 drops anise oil </li>
      <li> 3 ¼ cups all-purpose flour </li>
      <li> 1 tablespoon baking powder </li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Steps</h4>
    <ol>
      <li> Gather all ingredients. </li>
      <li> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C). Grease two cookie sheets or line with parchment paper. </li>
      <li> Beat sugar, oil, eggs, and anise extract together in a medium bowl until well-blended. Combine flour and baking powder in a separate bowl; stir into egg mixture to form a heavy dough. </li>
      <li> Divide dough into two equal pieces. Form each piece into a log the length of a cookie sheet. Place one log on each of the prepared sheets; and press dough down to 1/2-inch thickness. </li>
      <li> Bake in the preheated oven until golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes. Transfer logs to wire racks; let sit until cool enough to handle, about 15 minutes. </li>
      <li> Slice each log crosswise into about eighteen 1/2-inch-thick slices. Place slices cut-sides up back on the cookie sheets. </li>
      <li> Bake until lightly toasted and golden brown, 6 to 10 minutes per side. </li>
      <li> Serve and enjoy! </li>
    </ol>
